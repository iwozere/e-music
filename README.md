MySpotify is a high-performance, self-hosted music sanctuary. It eliminates subscription costs by combining a **FastAPI** backend with a lightweight, responsive **Vanilla JS** frontend.

- **Infinite Discovery**: "Radio Mode" uses YouTube's related tracks API to keep the music playing after your queue ends.

- **Self-Healing Indexer**: Background service that monitors your `/library` folder and updates the DB in real-time.
